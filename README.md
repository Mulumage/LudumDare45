Have you ever felt lost? Was there a time in your life when thought your stuck? Well, anything and anyone is BETTER THAN NOTHING!

Better than nothing is a fun little game that I developed for the Ludum Dare 45 - Start with nothing. I made the game withing 48 hours. I created all assets except the music and sounds within that time.

Are you brave enough to enter an empty room full of nothing?
Are you crazy enough to make your own life killing decisions?
Are you eager enough to reach for a higher score than 0?

Whatever you answered, it's better than nothing.

Features:
- One Room!
- One Character!
- A Ground!

Maybe you could add some more features, I'm thinking about enemies, interfaces, gameplay mechanics and cosemtics.


Thanks for playing my game, I hope you have as much fun playing it than I had developing it.
